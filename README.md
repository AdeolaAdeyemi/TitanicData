# TitanicData
This is a dataset used to determine people who survived (or not) on a titanic ship. This project is an attempt to learn and understand Machine Learning and the ability to make predictions from data by 'training' and 'testing'.

# Getting Started
First of all, relax. Grap a cup of tea or two because this is going to be a long and interesting ride. 
Through this, we will learn the importance of Hypertuning, Logistic Regression (or Linear whichever the case may be), line of best fit, correlation and most importantly, data cleaning.

# Prerequisites
- Jupyter notebook
- Titanic Dataset (Kaggle)
